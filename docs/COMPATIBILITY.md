# Supported compatibility subset

This inventory describes tested behavior, not general yt-dlp compatibility.
All extraction and downloads run in Rust. Python is development tooling only.

## CLI

| Option | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Positional URLs | One or more HTTP(S) URLs, processed sequentially; continue after errors, return failure if any URL fails |
| `-j`, `--dump-json` | One supported `VideoInfo` JSON object per video, including each HTML5 playlist entry; extract without downloading |
| `-s`, `--simulate` | Extract metadata, write diagnostics to stderr, create no media files |
| `-f`, `--format` | Literal zero-based HTML5 source ID per element; applies to every playlist entry and must exist in each; required for multiple sources; no expressions, ranking, merging, or direct-URL format IDs |
| `-o`, `--output` | `title`, `id`, `ext`, `extractor` string fields and literal `%%`; no overwrite |
| `--retries` | Additional download attempts, integer 0–255, default 3; no `infinite` value or extraction retries |
| `-h`, `--help`, `-V`, `--version` | Clap help and crate version |
| All other flags | Rejected; aliases such as `--skip-download` and `--print` are not implemented |

Simulation and JSON still make network requests. This inventory does not claim
upstream equivalence for every option interaction or filename rule.

## HTML5 extraction

The generic fallback dispatches a single response to direct-media inspection or
HTML5 parsing. Site extractors registered through `Extractor` run first. The
standalone `DirectHttp` extractor remains available for direct-only callers.

For `text/html`, accept `video`/`audio` elements with nonempty
`src` and/or direct child `source[src]` declarations. Resolve URLs against the
final page URL and first `base[href]`; decode HTML entities using an HTML5 parser. Prefer Open Graph
title, then document title, then page filename stem; collapse title whitespace.
Skip elements without nonempty `src` or direct child `source[src]` declarations. One retained element is a
video; two or more form an HTML5 playlist in document order. Append `-1`, `-2`, …
to entry IDs and ` (1)`, ` (2)`, … to titles, as upstream HTML5MediaEmbedIE does.
Number retained entries contiguously, ignoring empty elements. All-empty pages
fail as unsupported. The playlist wrapper has the unsuffixed page ID/title,
`generic` / `Generic` extractor identity, and the final page `webpage_url`.
Without a page title the wrapper title is `video`, while entry titles use the
page filename stem. Subtitle-only elements remain outside the supported subset.
Metadata identifies `html5` / `HTML5MediaEmbed` with `direct: false` and the final
page URL as `webpage_url`. Every source is probed with the page referrer and must
serve supported direct HTTP media. Redirected source URLs and response-derived
extensions/filesizes are recorded in typed `VideoFormat` entries. HTML5 JSON adds
`formats` and the selected `format_id`, including for a single source. IDs are
literal zero-based strings assigned to nonempty declarations: the media element's
`src` first, then direct child sources in document order. Duplicate URLs remain
separate declarations. Source IDs restart at `0` for each element. These IDs are
Rust-specific; upstream's label/title IDs,
format sorting, and fallback expressions are not implemented.

A single source is selected automatically. Multiple sources require `-f ID`;
omitting it or requesting an unavailable ID returns an error listing available
IDs. `best`, `worst`, filters, merge and fallback expressions are errors. Direct
HTTP results expose no format IDs, so an explicit `-f` on them fails. The library's
`extract_info_with_format` performs the same selection; standalone extractor
callers must call `VideoInfo::select_format` to resolve candidates before download.
Selection updates top-level `url`, `ext`, `filesize`, and `format_id` together.
The selected source is downloaded with the page referrer. If the download
response changes to HTML or a manifest, fail without publishing it as media.

HTML bodies are limited to 2 MiB, including responses without Content-Length.
Only uncompressed UTF-8/ASCII HTML is supported. Other encodings are rejected
when declared in HTTP Content-Type; invalid UTF-8 is rejected. HTML meta charset
sniffing, compressed responses, XHTML, JavaScript, nonstandard lazy-loading
attributes, subtitles, posters, durations, codecs, dimensions, authentication,
and general embedded-player extraction are not implemented. HLS/DASH URLs/type
hints and non-HTTP sources fail explicitly, even
when another supported source was explicitly selected. Unselected source probe
failures also fail extraction rather than hiding unsupported alternatives.
Every entry and alternative is validated before a result is returned. A failed
probe or format selection fails the whole input before downloads or JSON output;
selection errors identify the entry. A failed transfer or output-path collision
sets a nonzero CLI exit status while later entries and input URLs continue.
Fixed output paths may therefore collide; the default template includes each
entry's distinct ID. Existing files are never overwritten.

The library exposes `ExtractResult::Video(VideoInfo)` and
`ExtractResult::Playlist(PlaylistInfo)` through `extract_result` and
`extract_result_with_format`. Serde encodes the result enum using `_type: video`
or `_type: playlist`; playlist entries are ordinary `VideoInfo` objects.
`extract_info` / `extract_info_with_format` still return single videos. They
reject playlists rather than silently choosing the first entry; extraction and
format-selection errors can precede that boundary error. Existing custom
`Extractor::extract` implementations use the default `extract_result` adapter;
playlist-capable extractors override it. Standalone extractor callers must resolve
format selection themselves. The CLI flattens results into per-video NDJSON,
simulation diagnostics, or sequential downloads; it exposes no playlist wrapper
JSON option, playlist selection, nested playlists, or unresolved URL results.

MIME checks identify supported responses; they do not verify media containers.

## Download retries

The default download policy permits three additional attempts after HTTP 408,
429, 500, 502, 503, or 504, connection/timeouts, response body read errors, or
Content-Length mismatches. `--retries 0` disables retries; values through 255
are accepted. The library exposes `DownloadOptions { retries }` through
`YoutubeDl::download_with_options`; `download` uses the default policy.
After the retry budget is exhausted, return the final attempt's error.

After a body interruption, a retry can reuse bytes already written in the same
private temporary file. This requires a known Content-Length and a valid strong
ETag from the **download** response, an identity-encoded body, and a nonzero
stored offset below the total. The retry sends `Range: bytes=N-` and `If-Range`
with that ETag. A 206 response is accepted only with the same final URL and ETag,
identity encoding, and a single valid Content-Range covering exactly `N` through
`total - 1` with the original total. Content-Length, when present, must match the
remaining length; the received body is also checked against that length. Further
interruptions advance the offset and consume the same retry budget. Transient
HTTP errors preserve the offset without appending their bodies.

A full response to a range request replaces the temporary contents from byte
zero, including when the representation changes. Missing/weak/malformed ETags,
unknown initial lengths, and encoded responses use whole-file retries instead.
Last-Modified alone is not used as a validator. Invalid/changed partial responses
and HTTP 416 fail explicitly, without publishing a file or guessing completion.
Temporary files are removed on final failure. Resume across invocations, saved
partial files, multipart ranges, and fixed-size range chunk downloading are not
implemented.
The offset/length checks also apply when a 206 body omits Content-Length.

Backoff is 100, 200, 400, 800, then 1000 milliseconds between attempts, capped
at one second thereafter; Retry-After headers are not interpreted. These are
native subset policies, not upstream retry-default or HTTP-status parity.

Every attempt repeats response validation and preserves the HTML5 page referrer.
Other HTTP statuses (including 401, 404, and 501), unsolicited 206 responses,
unsupported HTML5 media responses, output collisions, and filesystem failures
fail immediately. Network reads and filesystem writes are handled separately so
a local write failure cannot trigger another network transfer. The final file
is published only after the complete representation has been received and is
never overwritten.
Extraction, page reads, and source probes are not retried, including under
`--simulate` or `--dump-json`. The per-request timeouts still apply to each
attempt; there is no overall download deadline or cancellation API.

This slice is based on the same pinned revision
**897341241f2bfb2439fe0367f4c7c9ccd29a3828**, specifically
`yt_dlp/downloader/http.py`'s `RetryDownload`/`RetryManager` control flow,
transport-read failures, and Content-Length validation. Its broader 5xx retry
handling remains outside this slice.
The range slice additionally references `establish_connection`, `retry`, and
`download` in that file: range requests, Content-Range checks, retained byte
counts after interrupted reads, and short-response retries. Strong ETag/If-Range
and final-URL checks are stricter native policies; upstream does not implement
these guards. Upstream's heuristic HTTP 416 completion and persistent partial
files are deliberately excluded. The baseline's
`test/test_downloader_http.py` was reviewed for its localhost HTTP fixture,
known/unknown length, and chunk/range cases; `tests/retries.rs` adds independent
deterministic failure/recovery coverage for validated 206 responses, repeated
interruptions, range rejection, changed representations, unknown lengths, and
validator boundaries. This ports a transport slice from the
existing baseline and does not advance it.

## Source and differential fixtures

This slice uses the existing baseline, **897341241f2bfb2439fe0367f4c7c9ccd29a3828**:

- `yt_dlp/extractor/generic.py`: response dispatch, HTML embed orchestration, and single-vs-playlist dispatch.
- `yt_dlp/extractor/genericembeds.py`, `HTML5MediaEmbedIE`: numbered entry metadata for single videos and playlists.
- `yt_dlp/extractor/common.py`, `_parse_html5_media_entries`: media/source parsing.
- `test/test_InfoExtractor.py`, `test_parse_html5_media_entries`: inline video,
  nested sources, multiple formats, relative URLs, and manifest examples reviewed.
- `yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py`: playlist entry processing and per-entry JSON output
  reviewed for the bounded sequential orchestration subset.

The full upstream helpers support many behaviors outside this Rust subset.
This is a new port slice from the pinned revision, not an upstream update; the
global baseline has not advanced.

Run the optional differential harness against an official checkout at that SHA:

```sh
cargo build --locked
python3 tools/compare_html5.py --upstream .upstream/yt-dlp --binary target/debug/yt-dlp-rs
```

The harness serves `tests/fixtures/html5/{video,audio,source,formats,playlist,playlist-formats}.html` and fixed media
bytes on localhost. It invokes upstream with only Generic and HTML5MediaEmbed
enabled and compares `id`, `title`, `ext`, `url`, `webpage_url`, `extractor`, and
`extractor_key` exactly. The sole URL normalization removes the fixture server's
exact origin. Query strings, fragments, paths, titles, and suffixes are preserved.
Other fields (including upstream timestamps and fields outside VideoInfo) are
excluded by this explicit allowlist. No volatile-value masking is applied within
the compared fields. Rust-specific boundary behavior is covered by `tests/http.rs`.
For playlists the
harness compares every entry in order and requires the exact entry count. The
CLI emits per-entry NDJSON, so wrapper fields are covered by library integration
tests rather than this differential harness.

The multi-source fixtures have explicit upstream labels `0` and `1` so each
implementation can request the same source without equating their general ID
assignment rules. Both selections are compared, including for every playlist
entry. The format list, probe sizes,
and Rust-specific IDs are covered by deterministic Rust tests rather than the
upstream metadata allowlist. The multi-source fixture uses page-relative URLs;
`base[href]` resolution remains a separately tested Rust behavior because the
pinned upstream HTML5 embed path does not apply it in this fixture.

The comparison needs upstream source and is optional; required tests need no
upstream checkout, Python runtime integration, or live sites. Six fixtures do
not establish broad extractor parity. Site playlists, playlist selection, and
recursive result processing remain unimplemented.
